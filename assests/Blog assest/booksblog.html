                    <img src="/images/books/1984.jpg" alt="" class="sub_image_blog" style="width: auto;"> <br>

                     <b><u>Why You Should Read It</u></b> <br>
                    George Orwell’s dystopian masterpiece "1984" is a chilling portrayal of a totalitarian regime where
                    individuality is suppressed, and surveillance is constant. Set in a world ruled by the Party and its

                    freedoms. Orwell’s vision of a world where truth is malleable and controlled by those in power is
                    both terrifying and thought-provoking, making it an essential read in today’s world. <br>
